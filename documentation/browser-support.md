title: Browser support

Knockout is tested on the following browsers:

 * Mozilla Firefox 2.0+ (latest version tested = 3.6.8)
 * Google Chrome (tested on version 5 for Windows and Mac; should work on older versions too)
 * Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8
 * Apple Safari (tested on Windows Safari version 5, Mac OS X Safari version 3.1.2, and iPhone Safari for iOS 4; should work on newer/older versions too)
 * Opera 10 for Windows

It's very likely that Knockout also works on older and newer versions of these browsers, but there's only so many combinations I can check regularly! At the time of the last check, Knockout was also found to work on the following browsers (though I don't recheck these for every release):

 * Opera Mini
 * Google Android OS browser (OS version 2.2)

To get a good idea of how Knockout will run on another browser or platform, simply download [the source code](http://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout), then open `/spec/runner.html` on the browser. This will validate more than 100 behavioral specifications and produce a report of any problems. The pass rate should be 100% on all the browsers listed above.
